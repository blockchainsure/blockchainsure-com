            <h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p><b>TL;DR: We will <u>never</u> sell your data to anyone.</b></p>


<p>In light of growing concerns about companies selling customers’ private data, we thought this would be a good opportunity to tell you about what types of data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it.

    <p>Data is important. In fact, it’s the foundation on which most of the technology we’ve grown to love is built. Without it, services like ride sharing and music streaming wouldn’t exist. Data is what lets companies like ours personalize their service, making it instant, fun, and hassle free.

We use data to personalize coverages, prevent fraud, help our users perform instant changes to their policy, collect payments, and improve our advertising. But, what we don’t do, and never will, is sell your private information.</p>

<p>The data we require to provide our insurance services includes personal info that can identify you or be linked to you, such as your name, address, email, date of birth, social security number (only in cases that we explicitly ask for it), basic employment information, and your IP address. A full list of the categories of info we collect and don’t collect can be found below.</p>

<p> Here’s how we may use your data:</p>

<p><b>Using our Online Services</b></p>

<p>We collect anonymous website traffic to help us analyze performance in certain markets and improve our ad efficiency. We may use the technical information and related data as described below to improve and offer you content, products, or services. For example, we evaluate the efficiency of ad campaigns by tracking visits to Blockchainsure from these campaigns. We’re using secure, industry-standard, third-party tools to analyze this data.</p>

<p><b>Obtaining Insurance Quotes</b></p>

<p>To be able to offer the best coverage at the right price, insurance companies evaluate the risks involved. For example, to be able to insure a blockchain exchange wallet, we collect the wallet's exact public key as well the customer’s name so we can get their transaction history on the exchange. If you’re an enrolled user on a Blockchainsure wallet policy or voluntarily activated location services on our app (“Wallet User”), your usage of our app and your trading habits (“Trading Data”) will be used to analyze and evaluate your risk profile, which may ultimately be used as one of the determining factors of your premium. To the extent allowed by law, your policy may be declined, cancelled, or non-renewed based solely on your, or other users’ Trading Data. We may, in some cases, require personal, identifiable information such as full name, date of birth, driver’s license and social security number.</p>

<p><b>Fighting Fraud</b></p>

<p>To be able to detect potential fraud attempts, we may collect past property or personal transaction history, as well as things like criminal background information.</p>

<p>Paying for, and using insurance</p>

<p>To evaluate risk, we may ask for documents, pictures as well as other information for proving ownership, condition, and value. When buying a policy, we use a third-party vendor to securely collect credit card information to handle payments.</p>

<p><b>Filing Claims</b></p>

<p>To be able to review off-chain claims, we ask users to provide various documents in the form of videos, pictures, signatures, receipts, appraisals, and so on. To pay claims we require bank account details, as well as personally verifiable info such as the claimant’s social security number. If you are enrolled in a Blockchainsure car policy, Driving Data for each driver may be helpful in determining the cause of a loss. We may review this data as part of our investigation and review of a claim, as well as for improving our systems and services. The Driving Data may be sought by third parties, such as opposing parties in a civil lawsuit or by police when investigating a claim.

<p><b>Pricing and underwriting</b></p>

<p>We may use Trading Data to develop new insurance products and services, improve the accuracy of our rates, and optimize our underwriting. From time to time, Trading Data may be provided to state insurance departments or third party service providers, on an aggregated and anonymized basis.</p>

<p><b>Cookies and First/Third-party Tracking</b></p>

<p>“Cookies” are small bits of info that a website sends to a computer’s hard drive when a website is viewed. We use cookies and clear GIFs. We participate in behavior-based advertising which means a third party uses tech (like a cookie or web beacon) to collect info about your use of our website so that they can provide ads tailored to your interests on our site or other sites.</p>

<p><b>Marketing and Advertising</b></p>

<p>We may use Cookies to help us optimize our digital campaigns, and to allow our customers to have a more personalized experience when coming back to our website.</p>

<p><b>We will always maintain our commitment to protecting your privacy.</b></p>

<p>If there are changes to our privacy policy, or in the event we suffer a breach to your data, we will make sure to notify you via email, regular mail, or phone - as required by law. The data and information we collect is processed and analyzed using secure, industry-standard, internal and third-party tools.</p>
