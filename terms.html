                <p>These Terms and your use of the Services are governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws. Any dispute concerning the Services or these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive venue of a court of competent jurisdiction in New York, New York.</p>
                
                <p>General</p>
                
                <p>We reserve the right to discontinue or modify any aspect of the Services at any time without notice to you, unless notice is otherwise required under applicable law. We may take any measures to ensure your compliance with the Terms. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, and any other legal notices published by us on the Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between us concerning the Services. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and a party’s failure to assert any right or provision under these not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
                
                <p>For residents of the EU / EEA:</p>
                
                <p>Blockchainsure and its subsidiaries (collectively “Blockchainsure”) are participants in the EU / US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Blockchainsure adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (the “Principles”) with respect to such data and continues to do so regardless of the European Commission invalidating the Privacy Shield on July 16, 2020. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy notice and data subject rights under the Principles, the Principals shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/. Blockchainsure is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
                
                <p>Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, EU individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States. Upon request, we will provide you with the access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may also correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you if it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the Principles. An individual who seeks access should direct their query to support@blockchainsure.com. If an individual requests to correct, amend, or delete their personal information transferred to the US under Privacy Shield, we will coordinate with our EU affiliate to complete this request, unless an exception applies. Please note that your rights are not absolute and may be subject to regulatory requirements, third parties’ rights and our own legitimate interests.</p>
                
                <p>We will provide an individual opt-out choice, or opt-in for sensitive data, before we share your data with third parties other than as described in this privacy policy, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to support@blockchainsure.com.</p>
                
                <p>Blockchainsure is required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Blockchainsure’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the US under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Principles. In particular, Blockchainsure remains responsible and liable under the Principles if third parties that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Blockchainsure proves it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
                
                <p>Blockchainsure also relies on standard contractual clauses to transfer EU personal data to third countries outside of the EU not recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate protection. Furthermore, Blockchainsure commits to cooperating with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and complying with the advice given by such authorities, including the European Data Protection Board, with regard to human resource data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship. In compliance with the Principles, Blockchainsure commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Blockchainsure at support@blockchainsure.com.</p>
                
                <p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact support@blockchainsure.com. Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website (https://www.privacyshield.gov/), you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield, Blockchainsure is potentially liable. You have the right to access your personal data and, under certain circumstances, limit the use and disclosure of your personal data, request deletion, and seek to correct any errors in your data. Please contact support@blockchainsure.com.</p>
